# cheatsheets
This repo contains a few handful cheetsheets that I have either collected from different sources, or created myself. 
The cheatsheets largely encompass Python (data science modules of python), HTML, CSS and JavaScript (including its different frameworks/libraries)
Will update this as and when I come across something useful.
